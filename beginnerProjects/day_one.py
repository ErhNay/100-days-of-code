# # String Manipulation and the Input Function
# # The input function accepts user's input
# #The Len Function calculates the length of the user's input
# # Print function displays the value to the user in the console
# print(len(input("What is your name?\n")))
#
# # Variables
# name = input("Type your name please:\n")
# print("Your name is : " + name)
#
# # The Switching game
# # Given inputs a=4 and b=5, switch the values of a and b such that, a=5 and b =4
#
# a = input("Please enter the value of 'a': ")
# b = input("Please enter the value of 'b': ")
# c = a
# a = b
# b = c
# print("a is now: " + str(a))
# print("b is now: " + str(b))
